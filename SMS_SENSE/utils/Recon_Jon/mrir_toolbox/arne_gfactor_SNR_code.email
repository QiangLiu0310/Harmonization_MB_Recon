I just got this from Arne. Does it answer our questions and reveal
what is different about your implementation?

Hi Graham,

 

Sorry for the delayed answer:

 

The two variables corg1 and corg2 are the regularization and
"smoothing" parameters.

corg1 loads the main diagonal prior to matrix inversion.

corg 2 smoothes the appearance of the final image by adding some
threshold to the noise.

 

The code below is the line-by-line treatment of the data.

2d acceleration is treated like 1d acceleration. I simply reformatted
the data so that all points that will be accelerated are on the same
line.

 

Regards, Arne

I hope everything is going well for you in Florida. Winter is
certainly setting in here. Things are going well at NYU. We managed
to submit 7 RF abstracts to ISMRM even though we are still building
up the RF lab. I have a little question for you relating to the
Sloader program.

 

I have finally submitted a paper on the 96 channel head coil. I used
g-factor maps generated with Sloader, and one of the reviewers has
asked for more detail on how they are generated. Would you be able to
offer any clarification, given that you understand what is going on
"under the hood"? Jonathan has achieved very similar results with his
methods, but never reproduced the Sloader results exactly, and there
are qualities to the Sloader g-factor maps that I prefer and believe
correspond more closely to reality. My standard settings are to use
25% of the phase encode lines and to leave the conditioning factors
both set to the default of 1. Below is what I wrote in the paper and
what the reviewer requested. Any help you can offer is greatly
appreciated.

 

"Because errors in the sensitivity map estimation can be amplified
when computing the g-factor, the calculation was mildly regularized
by diagonal loading."

 

 Reviewer comment: "the calculation was mildly regularized by diagonal loading."    Can

this be quantified so that others would feel comfortable that they are following a

similar analysis procedure?
